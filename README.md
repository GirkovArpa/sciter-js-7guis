# SciterJS 7GUIs

[7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks) benchmarks implemented in [SciterJS](https://sciter.com).

Run the implementations by placing [scapp.exe](https://github.com/c-smile/sciter-js-sdk/tree/main/bin.win/x32) in this folder and running the appropriate `.bat` file.

The x32 version seems to support things the x64 version does not.
